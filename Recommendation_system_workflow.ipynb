    ">Crunchyroll and Funimation have been the leaders in the anime industry. They have been providing the best and newest anime shows and movies on their respective streaming apps. Funimation is known for having English dubbed versions of anime on their platform while Crunchyroll is best known for having the Japanese and English Subbed versions on their platform. Earlier this year, Sony Pictures Entertainment, the company that owns Funimation, acquired Crunchyroll. After this acquisition, Sony decided to keep and maintain the Crunchyroll brand and streaming platform and slowly phase out its Funimation platform. This means Funimation content including shows and movies will be moving to Crunchyroll’s streaming platform. For Funimation users, they will have to eventually acquire a Crunchyroll subscription to watch their favorite shows and movies. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">I found this to be a great opportunity for Crunchyroll to revamp their recommendation systems by creating a content based recommendation system using both the existing Crunchyroll titles and the new Funimation titles that will be coming to the platform. A recommendation system will provide new and existing content to the Crunchyroll users. The Funimation users that transition to Crunchyroll can use this recommendation system to find new shows that maybe were only available on Crunchyroll. The goal of this project is to develop a content based recommendation system and deploy it through an app on Streamlit for Crunchyroll to use."

    ">The goal of this notebook is to use the data collected from JustWatch.com to create a content based recommender system. This notebook will first clean the data and preprocess it. Once the data is preprocessed, I will create two recommender systems. One using cosine similarity and the other using a nearest neighbors approach. Evaluation of the two systems will take place to determine which one to use for the final recommender system. I will create a streamlit app using the final recommender system that will allow users to enter in a title, number of recommendations, type of content, and genre to have similar titles recommended. \n",

    ">The process for filling and cleaning `genre_ids` is longer than the rest of the other columns. First, I have to fill the missing values with genres of those shows by researching the shows on other websites to find information on what genres they are. Then I will have to match the genres of those shows with the genres that justwatch.com uses so they are consistent with the other shows and movies. I will get a dictionary from the JustWatch API of all the genre titles and Ids for each genre. Once I fill in the null values, I will have to clean the remaining rows of the column. The values in the `genre_ids` columns are currently a list of numbers with the numbers corresponding the specific genre. I want to change the numbers in the list to the actual name of the genre. For example, I want to convert '1' to 'Action & Adventure'. I'll do this so I can easily identify the genre of each show and movie."
